IMPLEMENTER'S INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION ON P02M0099 (2026-09-09T20:30:00Z):

Scope: `docs/todo/P02M0099.md` is a NON-COMPLETABLE INDEX by its own status line and by the
roadmap's `[i]` row - never ticked, closed item by item. What this job owns of it is what its own
rules make startable: the items whose prerequisites exist and whose item plan is written. Read
before touching anything:

- Section 0, the Phase-2 maintenance subsection, gates every item on THE HOST-TEST SEAM (its
  first item) and on P02M0172's declared DMA policy. `virtio-blk maintenance` is the one item with
  its plan written ("THE ITEM PLAN IS WRITTEN (2026-08-31)"); the other six maintenance items and
  every group-1/2/3 item are subject to "NO ITEM IS STARTED WITHOUT ITS OWN WRITTEN PLAN", which
  this implementer does not write for them (that is planning, and the index says why it is
  declined in advance).
- "THE INDEX GETS A STATE OF ITS OWN": `check-milestone-index.sh` already knows the `[i]` marker
  (title-checked, never counted open, an unknown marker refused in its self-test) and
  `docs/todo/TODO.md` carries both this index and P02M0103 as `[i]`. The item is landed; the tree
  did not say so in the item's own checkbox.
- P02M0172 declared every driver row's DMA policy in `src/user/services/manifest.toml` and made the
  kernel admit from the generated registry. That is the "declare its DMA policy" clause of six
  maintenance items; the rest of each of those items stays open and is not started here.
- The host-test strategy did not compile: `cargo test --manifest-path src/user/drivers/core/Cargo.toml`
  failed with E0152 (rt's `panic_impl` against std's), which the index records as a prerequisite of
  the whole section.

## What was implemented

**The host-test seam (cfg/feature design).** `src/user/runtime/rt` gained the feature
`host-tests`: it drops the `_start` stubs and `__rt_start`, the allocation-error hook, the
`#[panic_handler]` and the `#[global_allocator]` registration, and replaces the architecture
`syscall` entries with one that answers `ERR_UNSUPPORTED` - there is no kernel on the host, and a
wrapper reached from a pure-layer test must fail the way a missing facility fails rather than
execute the host kernel's syscall of the same number (`SYS_YIELD` is 21, which Linux reads as
`access`). `src/user/drivers/core/Cargo.toml` enables it through `[dev-dependencies] rt = {
features = ["host-tests"] }` - cargo unifies a dev-dependency's features into `cargo test` and into
no other build, so shipped programs never see it - and marks every `[[bin]]` `test = false`: the
programs are `no_std` and carry no harness. `lib.rs` is `#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]`. The
gate the plan states for this design, `cargo test --manifest-path src/user/drivers/core/Cargo.toml`
from the repository root (the host target), runs the library's suite: 8 tests.

**DRV-001, central virtqueue validation** (`src/user/drivers/core/src/virtio.rs`): `UsedFault`,
`check_used_element` (the id is one the ring has and, on the synchronous path, the posted head; the
length is at most the chain's device-writable bytes) and `check_used_advance` (the used index never
moves past the buffers outstanding, wrapping as a free-running `u16`); `ring_layout` shared by
`setup_queue` and the fake controller; `Queue` tracks `posted` (up on `post_recv` and
`submit_async`, down on `take_used`) and `fault`; `take_used` checks the index before it believes it
and the element before it returns it; `submit` is `submit_checked(...).ok()`, and `submit_checked`
refuses an empty or over-long chain, a request the device never completes, more than one completion,
a completion that is not descriptor 0, and a length past the chain's writable bytes. The seam:
`Queue::over(virt, size, notify)` under `cfg(test)`, and `src/virtio/tests.rs` drives it over a
`Vec<u64>`-backed ring with the device's half written by hand (the synchronous completion from a
thread, since `submit` samples the index before it publishes). `post_recv`/`submit_async` take
`&mut self` now; every caller already held a mutable queue.

**DRV-002 and DRV-003 / WIRE-002** (`src/user/drivers/core/src/blk.rs`, `virtio_blk.rs`): the pure
decisions `request_range` (count zero or above the request limit refused, `lba + count` past the
capacity or overflowing refused - no clamp) and `write_source` (a memory object, readable through the
handle, at least `bytes` long - the three parts of one `object_info` answer), with `src/blk/tests.rs`.
The driver replies `STATUS_INVALID` (2, new, typed apart from `STATUS_ERR`) for either refusal, closes
a refused write's handle, and never asks the device; `serve_write` calls `object_info` before it
maps. StorageService treats any non-zero status as a failed request (`service.rs`, the
`status != 0` check), so the new code is a refusal to it today and a distinguishable one for a
consumer that wants to distinguish.

**The oracle** (`src/tools/check-qemu-virtio-iommu-x86_64.sh`, `src/user/services/storage/src/
service.rs`, `image.sh`): the traffic phase attaches a `virtio-blk-pci` endpoint with
`iommu_platform=on` carrying a run-private copy of the bootable system volume the medium's signed
manifest names, and asserts the driver's `driver.virtio-blk: online (bb:dd.f)` line, the kernel's
`iommu: bb:dd.f attached to domain` line for that address, and StorageService's new line
`storage: vol://system mounted through its block provider ...`, printed only after the partition
table and the superblocks were read over the provider's request channel and the mount succeeded.
The volume comes through `evidence_image` - the run's stored artifact inside a release run (image.sh
stores it beside the enforcing ISO), the tree's otherwise.

**The index state**: ticked in the index with the facts above; `docs/todo/TODO.md` unchanged
(`[i]`).

## Verification (so far)

- `cargo test --manifest-path src/user/drivers/core/Cargo.toml` (repository root): 8 passed.
- WATCHED TO FAIL, each debt under a compiling mutation of its check, then restored (sources
  compared byte-for-byte against the copies taken before): DRV-001 length bound disabled -> 4
  failed (every ring test); DRV-001 index bound disabled -> 4 failed; DRV-002 range check disabled
  -> `a_request_past_the_last_sector_is_refused_by_range` failed; DRV-002 count bound disabled ->
  `a_zero_count_and_a_count_above_the_request_limit_are_refused_not_clamped` failed; DRV-003 rights
  check weakened -> `a_write_source_must_be_...` failed; DRV-003 size check disabled -> the same test
  failed; restored -> 8 passed.
- `cargo build` of the driver crate and of the storage service for the x86_64 target: clean.
- `cargo check` of `rt` with `--features host-tests` on the host target and without on the shipping
  target: clean.
- `verify-model release-required --write`: 200 keys (`host.drivers / host / host / default` joined
  the frozen set, a reviewed act); `verify-model check`: consistent; 157 tests.
- `./check.sh --gate qemu-virtio-iommu-x86_64` with the block endpoint: RUNNING at the time of this
  entry (build, image, gate); the result is appended below.
- `./check.sh --gate qemu-virtio-iommu-x86_64` (after `./build.sh --arch x86_64` and
  `./image.sh --format iso`): PASSED end to end - the hostile phase under `gate` with
  `enforcing-required`, five refused cases plus the forced release, the traffic phase with BOTH
  endpoints behind the controller: a DHCP lease through virtio-net, and "the system volume was read
  through virtio-blk at 00:04.0, attached to a domain behind the controller" - the driver's online
  line, the kernel's attach line for that address and StorageService's read line all present; the
  default machine translated with nothing degraded; `--no-iommu` on the degraded image refusing
  virtio_net by name. One correction on the way: the gate's phase-2b assertion (written with
  P02M0172 and never exercised until now) grepped the suite's own output for the runner's row
  announcement, which lives in the run log the suite names; it reads the concatenated result logs
  now.
- NOT RUN YET: the whole kernel suite on aarch64 and riscv64 ("the suite green on all three
  targets" in the item's definition of done) - the emulated suites are part of the long run at the
  end of the whole job, and the virtio-blk item is left unticked until they are.
